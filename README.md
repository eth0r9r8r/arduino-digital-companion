This is a simple toy prototype I created as a proof of concept for a friend. He intends to make a small accessory with an OLED screen that cycles randomly between facial expressions, images, and animations. This accessory could be mounted on a car dash, or put on a keychain.

In its current state, the prototype only has three faces/animations, and is mounted on a breadboard. The device logic is run on an Arduino Uno. The next steps are to find a smaller chip to run the program on, and to print a shell that can house the components.

A video demo of the prototype can be found [here](https://youtu.be/57Eu4XJODpw).
